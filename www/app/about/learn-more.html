					Request It is an innovative way for you to broadcast something you desire that can be seen by anyone, and most importantly
					the person you are reaching out to. As the person being reached, our tool allows you to track your requests and its
					popularity and organize them. Request It empowers users to submit ideas to any person or company on the web. These posts
					or “Requests” are displayed on a multitude of websites via the “Request It! Widget” in addition to leveraging the power
					of social media to rally support for their idea so it gains momentum and gets noticed.

				<p class="flow-text mdc-text-blue-grey-800">
					Most people and companies collect ideas, feedback and suggestions via email, blog comments and social media. This makes processing
					these ideas and selecting the right ones tedious and lengthy. Request It’s Widget and Dashboard makes it a lot simpler
					and faster by providing a place for idea collection. Also, the capability to zero in on the right ideas. This results
					in a steady flow of ideas. The self-correcting nature of the community results in the elimination of bad ideas and the
					bubbling up of better and popular ideas.
