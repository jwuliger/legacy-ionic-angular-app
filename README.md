# Request It, Inc. MVP Mobile App (Legacy Ionic & Angular v1.x.x)

This is a legacy hybrid mobile app that was used as an MVP for my last company. It is always embarrasing showing code you have written a few years ago!

I have made sure the app runs. Bugs are present due to the original enviroment not being setup. This will give you a good look at how I coded in 2015/2016. Things are so much better now :)

## Notes/Instructions

This application originaly ran on iOS and Android. Currently you can run this app on a local dev machine. You need to make sure that the legacy ionic cli is installed globally.

`npm install -g ionic@legacy`

Leave the Bower modules as they are. You will need to do an `npm install` and then run `ionic serve` to test in the browser or over a proxy. use `ionic run android --device` to deploy a debug APK build to an Android device.

Setting everything up with XCode is a little crazy so feel free to try if you like on a macOS system.

## The Stack

- AngularJS (1.5.7)
- Firebase RTDB (2.4.2)
- Ionic (1.3.1)
- Cordova 7
- Gulp & Ionic for builds
- The original Angular Material
- And more...

# Summary

The main purpose of this repository is for demonstrating work I have done.

The app is free to use if you find anything releveant!
